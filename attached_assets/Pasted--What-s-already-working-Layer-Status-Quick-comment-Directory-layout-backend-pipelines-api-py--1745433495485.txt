🔎 What’s already working

Layer	Status	Quick comment
Directory layout	backend/… pipelines/… api.py mirrors the spec we drafted.	Clear separation will pay off when you add unit tests and CI.
Pipelines	Three discrete modules (FEC, Congress, STOCK Act) with test harness.	Nice: idempotent test runner means you can smoke-test each source quickly.
FastAPI	CRUD + pipeline trigger endpoints with pagination.	Exposing a /pipelines/* namespace is perfect for future GitHub-Action or cron kicks.
DB mapping	Tables for politicians, votes, contributions, stock_trades.	You’re using integer PKs, but also store canonical IDs (fec_candidate_id, bioguide_id) so you can join across sources later.
🛠 High-impact improvements
1. Make the ETL incremental & resumable
Right now the scripts look like “download-full-file ➜ truncate table ➜ re-insert”. Switch to:

text
Copy
Edit
▪️ Last-modified header or checksum check
▪️ If unchanged → skip
▪️ Else → ingest only new rows (use created/updated_ts)
Why? FEC monthly receipts and GovInfo bundles are huge; incremental loads cut bandwidth and protect your DB.

2. Normalize politician identities early
Use bioguide_id (Congress), fec_candidate_id (FEC) and a generated surrogate key.

Build a tiny “alias” table so one join always resolves Jane Doe, even if the name string differs between datasets.

3. Queue heavy jobs
PDF → text (House/Senate disclosures) can block your async FastAPI worker.
Add a lightweight queue:

bash
Copy
Edit
# requirements.txt
celery[redis]  # or RQ / Dramatiq
Run Celery workers in a separate Replit “Service” so OCR doesn’t slow the API.

4. Observability
Create a pipeline_runs table:

| id | pipeline_name | started_at | ended_at | status | rows_ingested | log_url |

Return this meta in /pipelines/status so your future dashboard shows freshness at a glance.

5. Secrets & config
Replit lets you add secrets in Secrets Manager. Replace hard-coded paths like:

python
Copy
Edit
FEC_DOWNLOAD_URL = "..."
with

python
Copy
Edit
import os
FEC_DOWNLOAD_URL = os.getenv("FEC_DOWNLOAD_URL")
…and commit only .env.example.

6. Unit tests & CI
Add pytest with one happy-path test per pipeline (mocked sample files).
Wire up a GitHub Action that:

spins up Postgres,

runs tests,

lints with ruff or black.

📈 Road-map next 2-3 days
Incremental ingest (FEC first) → confirm row counts match the CSV diff.

Add Celery/RQ worker + Redis for STOCK Act PDF OCR.

Expose a GET /politicians/{id}/timeline endpoint that joins votes + money + stocks (will feed your UI & bot).

Hook your React frontend to that single timeline endpoint to render a quick PoC Money Map.
